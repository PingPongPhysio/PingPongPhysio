												I am a qualified table tennis coach and physiotherapist who has moved to the Milton Keynes area. Throughout my undergraduate degree in Sports Rehabilitation and my master's degree in Physiotherapy Pre-registration, I have moved towards being very passionate about combining both physiotherapy and table tennis to help promote long-term exercise. My main goal is to find multiple strategies to make this sport easier to understand and enjoyable to facilitate long-term physical activity.

											<h2>My table tennis journey</h2>
									</header>
										<p>
												I have had multiple coaches growing up and learnt many diverse aspects of table tennis through each coach. Through this experience, I have developed multiple teaching methods tailored to the type of player. Throughout my table tennis career, I was extremely fortunate to have input from multiple coaches between the ages of 7 and 17, who all provided care and support for my table tennis and personal development. They have impacted my values and skills to this day.

										<p>
										At the age of 16, I was selected to compete in the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia, where our team won a bronze medal in the event. I moved to Austria without my family, to train as a full-time table tennis athlete at Linz AG Froschberg Club for 2.5 years. I continued competing for England and playing in the league abroad in Spain while studying at the University of Nottingham. Afterwards, I decided to further enhance my physiotherapy skills at St George's University of London while coaching at my home club, Ellenborough Table Tennis Club, as well as at Woodford School.

										Change of table tennis nationality:
												</p>
											<p>
										I have decided to change my table tennis nationality to Seychelles. During the summer of 2023, three lovely table tennis friends and I were invited to a table tennis training camp in Seychelles, and I had a chance to visit my amazing family (my dad is from Seychelles) for the first time. I really connected with the people, culture and atmosphere. I felt valued in my table tennis and as a person, and I am beyond excited to represent them in future events. Currently, I have moved to the Milton Keynes area, and my dream is to see how far I can take my table tennis career and, along the way, teach, inspire, promote, and learn from others with PingPongPhysio.
