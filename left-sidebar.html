												I am a newly graduated physiotherapist and have moved to the Milton Keynes area. Throughout my undergraduate degree in Sports Rehabilitation and my masters degree in Physiotherapy Pre-registration, I have moved towards being very passionate about combining both physiotherapy and table tennis to help promote long-term exercise. My main goal is to find multiple strategies to make this sport easier to understand and enjoyable to facilitate long-term physical activity.

											<h2>My table tennis journey</h2>
									</header>
										</p>
												I had multiple coaches growing up and learnt many diverse aspects of table tennis through each coach. Luckily, throughout my table tennis career, I had about 5-7 coaches between the ages of 7 and 17 who provided care and support towards my table tennis and personal development. They have impacted my values and skills to this day (thank you to Urfi, Kristina, Zoli, Antony, Tibi, Mark, Atilla, Peter, Guri and Zsolt). I moved to Austria at the age of 16, without my family, to train as a full-time table tennis athlete at Linz AG Froschberg Club for 2.5 years. I further developed my game with exposure to inspiring top female players. I then moved to attend Nottingham University, where I achieved a First Class Honour in Sports Rehabilitation degree and adapted my table tennis strategies (thank you Kelly). I have recently just completed my Master's degree at St George's University of London and moved to the Milton Keynes area. Due to not being able to continue financially to compete for England, in 2023, I decided to change my table tennis nationality to Seychelles. My dad is Seychelios and I have had a passport since I was a baby. During the summer of 2023, I went to a table tennis training camp in Seychelles and visited my amazing large family for the first time. I really connected with the people, culture and atmosphere. I felt valued in my table tennis and as a person, and I am beyond excited to represent them in future events. My dream is to see how far I can take my table tennis career and, along the way, teach, inspire, promote, and learn from others with PingPongPhysio.
